For me **SentinelPass** is more than just code it is my first serious step into the world of cybersecurity. I developed this Python tool out of a personal motivation to address the real danger of weak passwords and a genuine desire to build something practical that contributes to protection. I focused on developing a method to discover complex patterns and expectations that attackers might exploit. This project represents the start of my journey and proves my ability to transform ideas into tangible security solutions.
Developing **SentinelPass** was full of struggles but it was a fantastic experience that taught me so much.

#### Key Challenges Faced:
1.  **Performance Struggle:** Initially I had great difficulty processing large password lists the program was extremely slow. I had to research professional solutions to optimize the code speed without wasting memory.
2.  **Classification Logic:** Determining the 'strength score' for passwords was a major intellectual challenge how could I fairly categorize a long but easily guessed password?

#### Technical and Personal Growth:
* **Learning How to Learn:** The most important lesson is that I learned how to research independently and find advanced technical solutions. I was forced to learn and implement data structures like **Hash Tables** to overcome the speed problem and achieve a massive leap in the tool's performance.
* **Technical Mastery:** I gained a real skill in using Regular Expressions to decipher complex patterns.
* **Deeper Insight:** The project reinforced my passion for programming and security confirming I am ready to commit the academic effort required to study Computer Science.
