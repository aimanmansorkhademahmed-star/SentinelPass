SentinelPass is a Python-based password strength analysis tool designed to evaluate password resilience using entropy, pattern detection, and heuristic scoring. It calculates Shannon Entropy, detects character-set weaknesses, and classifies passwords as Weak, Moderate, or Strong.

Core Features

Shannon Entropy computation for randomness evaluation

Detailed feedback on password composition

Heuristic scoring based on length & complexity

Regex-based pattern and structure detection

Real-time classification (Weak/Moderate/Strong)

Clean and modular Python code for easy extension


Technical Concepts Used

Shannon Entropy formula

Character pool size calculation

Regular Expressions for pattern matching

Heuristic scoring models

Python modular design
