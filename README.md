SentinelPass is a Python-based project developed to raise awareness about password security.
The tool evaluates password strength using multiple criteria such as length, character diversity, and entropy estimation.
Through this project, I learned how weak passwords contribute to security breaches and how basic security principles can be translated into practical tools that help users understand risks in a simple way.
